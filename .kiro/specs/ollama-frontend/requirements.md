# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a React-based web frontend that interfaces with an Ollama API backend. The frontend will provide users with an intuitive interface to interact with trained language models, manage conversations, and monitor model training status. The application will serve as a comprehensive dashboard for Ollama model interaction and management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to chat with my trained Ollama models through a web interface, so that I can easily interact with my AI models without using command line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a clean chat interface with a message input field
2. WHEN a user types a message and presses enter THEN the system SHALL send the message to the Ollama API and display the response
3. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator while waiting for the model response
4. WHEN the API returns a response THEN the system SHALL display the response in the chat interface with proper formatting
5. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select different trained models for my conversations, so that I can compare responses and use the most appropriate model for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL fetch and display a list of available Ollama models
2. WHEN a user clicks on a model selector THEN the system SHALL display all available models in a dropdown or list
3. WHEN a user selects a different model THEN the system SHALL update the active model for new conversations
4. WHEN a model is selected THEN the system SHALL display the current active model name in the interface
5. IF no models are available THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no models are found

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage multiple conversation threads, so that I can organize different topics and maintain context for various discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts the application THEN the system SHALL create a default conversation thread
2. WHEN a user clicks "New Conversation" THEN the system SHALL create a new conversation thread and switch to it
3. WHEN a user has multiple conversations THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar with all conversation threads
4. WHEN a user clicks on a conversation thread THEN the system SHALL load and display that conversation's history
5. WHEN a user deletes a conversation THEN the system SHALL remove it from the list and switch to another available conversation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the training status of my models, so that I can monitor progress and know when new models are ready to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL fetch and display the current training status from the API
2. WHEN a model is currently training THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator with training details
3. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL update the model list and notify the user
4. WHEN a user refreshes the training status THEN the system SHALL fetch the latest information from the API
5. IF training fails THEN the system SHALL display error information and suggested next steps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes, so that I can use it on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is viewed on desktop THEN the system SHALL display a full sidebar with chat area
2. WHEN the application is viewed on mobile THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout with collapsible sidebar
3. WHEN a user resizes the browser window THEN the system SHALL adjust the layout appropriately
4. WHEN viewed on any device THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and usability of all interface elements
5. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets for all interactive elements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the chat interface appearance, so that I can have a comfortable and personalized experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL provide options for theme selection (light/dark mode)
2. WHEN a user changes the theme THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the new theme across the interface
3. WHEN a user sets preferences THEN the system SHALL persist these settings in local storage
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL restore the user's previously saved preferences
5. WHEN using dark mode THEN the system SHALL ensure all text remains readable with appropriate contrast
